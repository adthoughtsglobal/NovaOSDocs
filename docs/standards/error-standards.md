# Error standards

Nova OS comes with a lot of features, therefore, 'some errors...

We have made a standard for all of these errors, so that we can just mention their codes without saying the whole thing.

* 0001: The item in process already exists
* 0002: Progress is being made.
* 0003: Couldn't complete task.
* 0004: The target / item in process does not exist.
* 0005: rewriting item.
* 0006: Target / item in process is damaged or corrupt. [Saw this error?](https://github.com/adthoughtsglobal/Nova-OS/wiki/What-is-Error-0006)
* 0007: not defined yet ⚠
* 0008: not defined yet ⚠
