# Styling standards

nova.css is a NovaOS feature that lets you apply NovaOS CSS on your application. This lets your application stay in the user's design choices. But for the default user, NovaOS, after a long time of research, has created a magic styling that's applied throughout NovaOS.

## How we chose Nova.CSS

#### **Typography and Responsive Scaling**

* **Font Selection and Scaling**:
  * Integrate a clean, modern font for legibility and consistency across devices.
  * Use scalable font sizes to adjust to different screen dimensions, maintaining readability from small to large displays.

#### **Color Palette**

* **Backgrounds**:
  * Establish a dark theme with distinct layers to create depth between primary, secondary, and highlighted areas.
* **Text and Accents**:
  * Use high-contrast text for readability against dark backgrounds.
  * Incorporate special colors to signify positive and negative states for quick visual feedback.

#### **Sizing and Spacing**

* **Border Radius and Element Shapes**:
  * Apply rounded corners at various intensities to balance between smoothness and defined structure.
* **Element Size Scaling**:
  * Ensure scalable sizing units for adaptable layout spacing that feels natural across screen sizes.

#### **Animations and Interaction Timing**

* **Action Timing**:
  * Set quick interactions on larger screens for responsiveness and extend timing for smaller screens to account for different user touch inputs.

#### **Scrollbar Customization**

* **Scrollbar Design**:
  * Blend the scrollbar with the dark theme, adding a subtle hover effect to maintain visual coherence and provide a clear interactive cue.

#### **Component Inheritance and Consistency**

* **Unified Element Styling**:
  * Remove default browser styles and inherit fonts and sizes for buttons, inputs, and textareas to create a seamless, integrated look across all components.
