NovaOS Panels in on development and lacks documentation. Consider browsing the JavaScript code for example panels in [here](https://github.com/runnova/dev/tree/main/libs/panelData).

Panels are widgets in NovaOS that appear in the Nova Nav. These are created with JavaScript and ran in separate web worker threads and are provided an API to interact with their allocated space for displaying HTML content.
