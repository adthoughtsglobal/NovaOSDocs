# The NovaOS Check list

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Search for the welcome file

The Welcome File is a default NovaOS file created when you create your NovaOS local account. This file contains information on support and references to its wikis.

You can use the NovaOS Smart Search to locate this file, click on the search icon in your Nova Nav.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Snap a window: multitask on the go.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unsupported in NovaOS touch mode. Please use a pointer-enabled device instead to use this feature.
{% endhint %}

On the default NovaOS settings, window snapping is enabled, which lets you 'snap' windows either to fullscreen or to either one of the two sides.

Snapping is just as simple as dragging a window by holding down and moving your cursor on the window header bar (hint: where the close button is.) and dropping it at the sides of your NovaOS desktop.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use NovaOS offline: just one click.

{% hint style="warning" %}
NovaOS offline makes your browser cache around 300kb of scripts in your device storage. Consider toggling this off before updating your NovaOS.
{% endhint %}

Go to the Settings app. Locate preferences and toggle on the setting labeled 'Use NovaOS Offline'.

That's it, if your device and browser support it (mostly everything does), you can now use the NovaOS Offline mode on your device - easy as that.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use a theme

NovaOS supports setting 'themes' that span across all system UI. NovaOS themes are available in the NovaOS Store app, where you can browse and apply the best themes with a single click.

You can also configure each theme parameter in the NovaOS Settings app. Head to 'Display' and click on 'Advanced theme settings' to tweak them or make completely new themes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Share your themes: Clean or wild

After you have made a custom NovaOS theme with the Advanced theme settings in the NovaOS Settings Apps' display page, you can copy a string that embodies the theme configuration - which can be easily shared with others.

You can copy and paste the themes by heading to the 'Display' page in the settings app and clicking 'Copy Theme'.&#x20;

To use a theme string someone else has made, you can head to the same 'Display' page and click 'Paste theme'.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Import your files

NovaOS is a sandboxed web desktop, it cannot access your files stored in your device without your action to do so. You can import your files to NovaOS by heading to the files app and clicking the Import button in the top right corner.&#x20;

In the file import dialog, click 'Upload files' to select your files. You can select multiple files in this operation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Importing files is a performance-intensive operation. Bulk-loading heavy files can cause a load in your browser tab or crash the browser.

NovaOS does not recommend importing files over 35MB to your NovaOS. Even though it's up to you to decide how much your device can handle.
{% endhint %}

After selecting your files, click on import to import them one after the other. You can wait until it says "File(s) Saved, Close" to close this modal. Interrupting this process will terminate the import process; keeping the files imported stored.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Sleep mode: take a nap.

Sleep mode is the NovaOS feature for those people who give their minds the rest they need.&#x20;

You can access this feature by heading to the Nova Menu in the Nova Nav. Click on the 'crescent moon' icon to open up the feature.

Sleep mode is a very easy-to-use timer: right in your Nova Menu. Display a message or select the countdown length without a message to start the timer. After the countdown, NovaOS will beep you awake and show what you were working on.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
