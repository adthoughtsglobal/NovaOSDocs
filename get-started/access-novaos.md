To use NovaOS in a mobile or a vertically screened device with a dynamic viewport, consider installing the OS as an app.

## Installing NovaOS as an App in Chrome

Chrome, or its alternatives like Edge, Opera, have mostly the same methods.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Open Chrome

From your default OS.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Go to [runnova.github.io/NovaOS](https://adthoughtsglobal.github.io/Nova-OS/)

and wait until NovaOS installs.

Once it's done, and you see a dock,
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Tap the menu button

on Chrome; you can find it in the top right corner outside NovaOS.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Tap "Install NovaOS" or "Add to home screen"

Now wait for your OS to make a dialog for its installation, install NovaOS, and you are done.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### From the app menu on your device, open NovaOS.

You now have your personal Web System ready to be used.
