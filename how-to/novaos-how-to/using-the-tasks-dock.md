# Using the Tasks Dock

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Tasks Dock in NovaOS 2.05</p></figcaption></figure>

NovaOS tasks dock is a wonderful tool if you need to multitask in NovaOS. Multitasking requires constant window management actions including minimizing, restoring, and reordering windows on the depth scale.

The task dock allows all these window management functions to be done with simple clicks on the icons of corresponding windows.&#x20;

* If the window is minimized, clicking the task restores it.
* If the window is over all other windows, clicking the icon minimizes it.
* If the window is not on top, clicking the icon brings it to the top instead of minimizing it.

The tasks dock will be automatically visible once you open an app.
