# Setting a custom wallpaper

NovaOS supports wallpapers that are user defined, local or hosted on a domain. To change or set your wallpaper, you can use either the files app or the settings app.

## Setting a local image file as wallpaper

1. After you have uploaded your target file into your local filesystem (Learn how), open the file's location in the files app.
2. Select the file by clicking on its name a single time.
3. On the toolbar that appears anew on the top section, click 'Set As'.
