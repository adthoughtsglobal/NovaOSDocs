# Setting a custom wallpaper

NovaOS supports wallpapers that are user-defined, local, or hosted on a domain. To change or set your wallpaper, you can use either the files app or the settings app.

## Setting a local image file as wallpaper

1. After you have uploaded your target file into your local filesystem ([Learn how](https://novaos.gitbook.io/main/how-to/novaos-how-to/using-default-apps/nova-files-app#importing-a-file)), open the file's location in the files app.
2. Select the file by clicking on its name a single time.
3. On the toolbar that appears anew on the top section, click 'Set As'.

## Setting an image URL as wallpaper

1. Go to the Settings app and find Display.
2. Scroll down to see the wallpaper section.
3. replace the value of the text input with your URL.
4. Click on Save to sync changes.
5. Reload your system to fully apply changes.

You can also use the same input to set local files as wallpapers. You can achieve this by pasting the file ID of the local file in the input and saving it.
