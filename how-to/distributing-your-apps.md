# Distributing your apps

Making apps in NovaOS is done by making HTML files following the NovaOS application syntax and the NTX api. But, how do I distribute these apps so that they would be useful for others too?

Nova Store is a moderated platform that gets installed by default in NovaOS, appearing on the apps dock from version 1.2 and above. This app showcases applications with a convenient single-click-installation for all of them.

## How to add my app to the NovaOS store?

In order to publish an app in the NovaOS Store, your application must be 'a single HTML file' in order to run as a NovaOS app. You can send the HTML file link in the `#projects` channel in our [Discord server](http://runnova.github.io/dis) after statically hosting it (here's a [reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/14bn9gr/best_freecheap_way_to_host_a_static_website_2023/) on it). If the application is useful and safe, it would be added to NovaOS store.&#x20;

If you have a NovaOS app HTML file hosted statically, you can share the app's URL so that people can directly install it through the store application without putting it in the NovaOS store at all.

## Application Installer apps

I agree, making an entire web application fit in a single HTML file is really annoying. App installers like those used in modern operating systems like windows are applications that configure and rebuild your application folder in the user system instead of running a single HTML file. NovaOS apps can also have installers, and use multiple files. I will be working on things that would making apps with installers easier soon.
