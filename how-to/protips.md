# Protips

* Too many windows open and you want to close them all? Open the Nova menu and click on 'close all windows'!
* Want to keep Dock apps updated without moving them after updates? Simply select a file to make a shortcut in the Dock/ folder! App IDs won't change after updates.
* Want to import multiple files? You can select multiple files and import them together!
* Want to take a short nap? Easily go to the Nova menu and click on 'sleep mode' to enter a dialog where you can start timers and display idle texts.
* To turn off your password, change your password to 'nova'.
* You can right-click an app to reinstall it. If it supports handling a default method, then it would register it once again. This is helpful if you have an app that is supposed to allow viewing a file or creating a service for dependent apps to use, isn't registered.
* You cannot delete the 'Admin' folder in NovaOS. But. You can completely remove all apps, files, and directories to keep it non-intrusive to your freedom.
* You can switch the text app to 'Reading mode' to help your eyes while reading long documents.
