# Publish to Nova Store

Making apps in nova is possible using the files app, text app and the studio app. But, how do i publish these apps i made so that it would be useful for others too?

Well, Nova Store is a highly moderated platform that's installed as default in Nova OS, appearing on the apps dock from version 1.2 and above. This app showcases applications with install buttons for all of them, crediting all its developers.

## How to add my app in Nova store?

You must make your app 'for nova' and should be 'a single file' to run as a nova app. The app should be hosted static. You can send its link in #projects channel in our discord server.
